DEFECT LOG INPUTS AND OUTPUTS

✅ What to enter in the form
The model was trained on defect summaries, so you should type short descriptions of issues like you’d see in Jira or bug reports. Examples:

- Invalid defect examples (should predict Invalid):

- “Duplicate bug already fixed in previous sprint”
- “Typo in settings page”
- “Issue reported without reproduction steps”





- Valid defect examples (should predict Valid):

- “App crashes on login when user enters wrong password”
- “Payment gateway throws null pointer exception during checkout”
- “Timeout error when fetching user details from API”



✅ What you’ll see after submitting
When you click Check Status, the app will return:
- Status → Valid / Invalid
- Confidence → e.g. 82.45%
- Valid % → Session percentage of valid predictions so far
- Invalid % → Session percentage of invalid predictions so far
